# Win11SandboxMalwareAnalysis
This is targeting Windows 11 Sandbox. In this environment, we have set up a configuration to enable dynamic analysis of malware within the sandbox and also perform static analysis using Ghidra. The installation file in the batch file needs to be modified to match the architecture of each individual environment. Additionally, this file is intended for operations within the Sandbox directory.
